  <h2>What's important to you?</h2>

  <p>The 3 pillars of my life are health, wealth and relationships, and the thread that runs through them is growth.</p>

  <p>We have one vehicle in this life, and that's our body. I try my best to take care of my mind and body, so health is a big thing I value.</p>

  <p>After health, it's hard to develop a meaningful life without some wealth. You can be healthy as an ox, but if you struggle to pay rent every month, that creates stress, and thus impacts your health. Everything interrelates.</p>

  <p>Lastly, even if I have all the health and money in the world, if I have no one to share it with I will be a sad and lonely person. I find much of life to be meaningless without other people. We are naturally social creatures, and the human experience
    is incomplete without...well, other humans. To this end, I always seek to create genuine, lasting relationships.</p>
